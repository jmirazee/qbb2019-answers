Genome wide association studies: Common disease common variant
Penentrence of common variants is low (percent of phenotypes that actually show the disease phenotytype)

Multiple alleles influence disease suceptiblity

one hypothesis test between every disease an SNP pair

***MULTIPLE TESTING PROBLEM***

P VALUE = the probability that you reject the null incorrectly. 

Can correct:
-remove any type 1 error across all familites: Bonferroni. Divide original critical value / number of tests


-control fraction of type 1 errors (FDR)

-Batch effect: Need to randomize
